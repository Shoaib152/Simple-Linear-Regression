**📌 Linear Regression Model – Height to Weight Prediction**
A simple and clean Machine Learning project that predicts a person’s weight based on their height using Linear Regression.
This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, visualization, and making predictions in Python using scikit-learn.

**🚀 Project Overview**

This project uses a dataset containing Height and Weight values to train a Linear Regression model.
The goal is to predict weight when a user enters their height.

This is a beginner-friendly ML project that helps understand:

Data cleaning

Feature/target selection

Linear Regression model

Model visualization

Prediction function

Pounds → Kilograms conversion

**✨ Features**

✔ Simple and easy to understand
✔ Uses Linear Regression
✔ Clean code with comments
✔ Predicts weight from height
✔ User-friendly input/output
✔ Converts final weight prediction into kilograms

**📁 Technologies Used**

Python 3

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

scikit-learn

**📊 Model Workflow**
Load dataset (Height & Weight)

Convert data into appropriate format

Split into features (X) and target (y)

Fit Linear Regression Model

Plot Regression Line

Predict weight using function

Convert predicted weight (lbs → kg)

**🧠 Prediction Formula**
height = float(input("Enter your height in feet: ")) * 12
weight_in_kg = predictedWeight(height) * 0.453592
print(f"Our model says your weight is about {weight_in_kg:.2f} Kgs")

**📸 Sample Output**
Enter your height in feet: 5.8
Our model says your weight is about 75.32 Kgs
